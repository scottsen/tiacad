## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - 2026-02-15

#### Examples API Compatibility (21 examples fixed, 50% → 95% pass rate)

**Auto-references examples** (4 fixed):
- Updated export format from deprecated list syntax to current dict syntax
- Examples: auto_references_{box_stack, cylinder_assembly, rotation, with_offsets}.yaml
- Now showcase auto-generated anchors feature correctly

**LEGO brick examples** (2 fixed):
- Updated cone primitive: `radius_bottom`/`radius_top` → `radius1`/`radius2`
- Updated pattern spacing: scalar + `direction: X` → vector `spacing: [dx, dy, dz]`
- Examples: lego_brick_2x1.yaml, lego_brick_3x1.yaml
- Created fix_pattern_api.py tool for automated migration

**Week5 examples** (2 fixed):
- Updated translate format: removed deprecated `offset:` wrapper for direct offsets
- Examples: week5_assembly.yaml, week5_frame_based_rotation.yaml
- Note: `offset:` still valid when used with `to:` parameter

**Multi-material example** (1 fixed):
- Updated pattern spacing API (same as LEGO bricks)
- Example: multi_material_enclosure.yaml

**Build artifacts**:
- Added *.3mf to .gitignore (generated output files)

**Result**: Examples now at 95.7% pass rate (44/46), up from 50% (23/46)

- **Test suite verified** - 1125 total tests (1062 passing, 45 skipped, 17 failing, 1 xfailed)
- **Test count updated** - Documentation now reflects actual 1125 tests vs outdated 896/1080 counts
- **Geometry validation confirmed** - Nov 2025 work successfully integrated (test_geometry_validation.py with 8 tests)

#### Known Issues Identified
- **Hull builder tests** (11 failures) - CadQuery 2.7.0 STL import compatibility issue in `cq.importers.importShape()`
  - Impact: Convex hull operations fail with "Unsupported import type: 'STL'"
  - Workaround needed: Alternative STL import method or CadQuery version adjustment
- **Visual regression tests** (6 failures) - Missing reference images in `visual_references/` directory
