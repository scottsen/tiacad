## Metadata

Optional section for documentation and version tracking.

```yaml
metadata:
  name: "My Design"              # Design name
  description: "What it does"    # Brief description
  version: "1.0"                 # Version number
  author: "Your Name"            # Who created it
  created: "2025-10-25"          # Creation date
  phase: 2                       # TiaCAD phase used

  # NEW in v3.2: Optional type and composition fields
  type: assembly                 # Document purpose (see below)
  composition: reference-based   # Makes mental model explicit
```

All fields are optional and for documentation only.

### Enhanced Metadata Fields (v3.2+)

**type** - Declares the document purpose:
- `part` - Single part design
- `assembly` - Multiple parts combined
- `model` - Complete model/design
- `mechanism` - Moving parts assembly
- `fixture` - Jig or mounting fixture

**composition** - Makes the mental model explicit:
- `reference-based` - TiaCAD's composition model (recommended)

These fields help readers immediately understand the document's purpose and design approach.

## References (Spatial Anchors) - v3.0

**What are references?** Spatial references (we call them **anchors**) are marked positions in 3D space where parts can be positioned or attached - like marking spots on a workbench. Think of `base.face_top` as "the anchor at the top of the base".

**New in v3.0:** TiaCAD introduces a unified spatial reference system that replaces the old `named_points:` section. This system supports not just points, but also faces, edges, and axes with full orientation information (position + direction).

**Key concept**: Instead of calculating coordinates manually, you position parts using anchors: `translate: to: base.face_top` instead of `translate: [50, 25, 10]`.

**Visual Guides:**
- [auto-generated anchor Visualization](docs/diagrams/auto-generated anchor-visualization.md) - See all auto-generated anchors
- [Local Frame Offsets](docs/diagrams/local-frame-offsets.md) - Understand how offsets work
- [Reference Chain Dependencies](docs/diagrams/reference-chain-dependencies.md) - Learn how parts reference each other

### Auto-Generated References

Every part automatically provides these references **without explicit definition**:

#### Universal auto-generated anchors (All Primitives)

Available for all parts (box, cylinder, sphere, cone):

| Reference | Description | Type | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------|
| `{part}.center` | Bounding box center | point | `base.center` |
| `{part}.origin` | Part origin | point | `pillar.origin` |
| `{part}.face_top` | Top face (>Z) | face | `platform.face_top` |
| `{part}.face_bottom` | Bottom face (<Z) | face | `platform.face_bottom` |
| `{part}.face_left` | Left face (<X) | face | `wall.face_left` |
| `{part}.face_right` | Right face (>X) | face | `wall.face_right` |
| `{part}.face_front` | Front face (>Y) | face | `panel.face_front` |
| `{part}.face_back` | Back face (<Y) | face | `panel.face_back` |
| `{part}.axis_x` | X-axis through center | axis | `shaft.axis_x` |
| `{part}.axis_y` | Y-axis through center | axis | `shaft.axis_y` |
| `{part}.axis_z` | Z-axis through center | axis | `shaft.axis_z` |

**Benefits:**
- No need to define common references manually
- Consistent naming across all parts
- Works with transforms and offsets
- Full orientation support (normals, tangents)

**Example Usage:**

```yaml
parts:
  platform:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 100
      height: 10
      depth: 100

  pillar:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 5
      height: 50
    translate:
      to: platform.face_top  # auto-generated anchor - no definition needed!

  cap:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 15
      height: 5
      depth: 15
    translate:
      to:
        from: pillar.face_top  # auto-generated anchor with offset
        offset: [0, 0, 2]      # 2 units above pillar
```

### Named References (Custom Anchors)

You can define custom anchors in the `references:` section when auto-generated ones don't suffice. Think of this as marking additional attachment points beyond the automatic ones.

**New in v3.2:** You can use `anchors:` as a user-friendly alias for `references:`. Both work identically!

```yaml
# Option 1: Using 'references:' (canonical, all versions)
references:
  mount_surface:
    type: face
    part: base
    selector: ">Z and <X"
    at: center

  hinge_axis:
    type: axis
    from: [0, 0, 0]
    to: [0, 0, 100]

  corner_point:
    type: point
    value: [50, 50, 0]

# Option 2: Using 'anchors:' (v3.2+, more intuitive)
anchors:
  mount_surface:
    type: face
    part: base
    selector: ">Z and <X"
    at: center

  hinge_axis:
    type: axis
    from: [0, 0, 0]
    to: [0, 0, 100]

  corner_point:
    type: point
    value: [50, 50, 0]
```

**Note:** Use either `references:` or `anchors:`, not both. They're aliases for the same thing!

### Reference Types

v3.0 supports four reference types:

#### 1. Point References

Simple 3D coordinates:

```yaml
references:
  corner:
    type: point
    value: [100, 50, 0]

  # Or inline
parts:
  bracket:
    translate:
      to: [100, 50, 0]  # Direct coordinate array
```

#### 2. Face References

Face with position + normal vector:

```yaml
references:
  mount_face:
    type: face
    part: base_plate
    selector: ">Z"     # Face selector (CadQuery syntax)
    at: center         # Optional: center (default), min, max

  # Using auto-generated face
parts:
  bracket:
    translate:
      to: base_plate.face_top  # Auto-generated face reference
```

**Face selectors:**
- `">Z"` - faces pointing in +Z direction
- `"<X"` - faces pointing in -X direction
- `">Z and <X"` - faces matching both conditions
- See CadQuery documentation for full selector syntax

#### 3. Edge References

Edge with position + tangent vector:

```yaml
references:
  rail_edge:
    type: edge
    part: frame
    selector: ">X and >Z"  # Edge parallel to X, on +Z face
    at: midpoint           # Optional: midpoint (default), start, end
```

#### 4. Axis References

Axis defined by direction vector:

```yaml
references:
  rotation_axis:
    type: axis
    from: [0, 0, 0]
    to: [0, 1, 0]       # Y-axis

  # Or use auto-generated axis
operations:
  rotated:
    type: transform
    input: gear
    transforms:
      - rotate:
          angle: 90
          around: shaft.axis_z  # Auto-generated axis
```

### Using References

References can be used anywhere a spatial location is needed:

#### In Translate Operations

```yaml
parts:
  mounted_part:
    translate:
      to: base.face_top  # Position at reference

  offset_part:
    translate:
      to:
        from: base.face_top
        offset: [0, 0, 5]  # Offset in face's local frame
```

#### In Rotate Operations

```yaml
operations:
  rotated:
    type: transform
    input: part
    transforms:
      - rotate:
          angle: 45
          around: base.face_top  # Rotate around face normal
```

#### Local Frame Offsets

Offsets follow the reference's local local frame:

```yaml
parts:
  bracket:
    translate:
      to:
        from: wall.face_front  # Face on +Y side
        offset: [5, 0, 10]     # X=5 right, Y=0 (perpendicular), Z=10 up
```

**Local frame orientation:**
- Face: Normal as Z-axis, tangent as X/Y
- Edge: Tangent as X-axis, normal as Z
- Axis: Direction as Z-axis
- Point: World local frame

---

## Parts

Parts are the basic building blocks. Each part starts from a primitive shape.

### Box Primitive

```yaml
parts:
  my_box:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 100                  # X dimension
      height: 50                  # Y dimension
      depth: 20                   # Z dimension
    origin: center                # center, corner, or [x,y,z]
```

**Origin modes:**
- `center`: Center at (0, 0, 0) - default
- `corner`: Min corner at (0, 0, 0)
- `[x, y, z]`: Custom origin point

### Cylinder Primitive

```yaml
parts:
  my_cylinder:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 10                  # Cylinder radius
      height: 50                  # Cylinder height
    origin: center                # center, corner, or [x,y,z]
```

### Sphere Primitive

```yaml
parts:
  my_sphere:
    primitive: sphere
    parameters:
      radius: 15                  # Sphere radius
    origin: center                # Usually center
```

### Cone Primitive

```yaml
parts:
  my_cone:
    primitive: cone
    parameters:
      radius: 20                  # Base radius
      height: 40                  # Cone height
    origin: center                # center, corner, or [x,y,z]
```

### Parts with Transforms

Apply transforms directly to parts:

```yaml
parts:
  rotated_box:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 10
      height: 20
      depth: 30
    transforms:
      - translate: [50, 0, 0]
      - rotate:
          axis: Z
          angle: 45
          origin: [0, 0, 0]
```

**v3.0 Transform Enhancements:**

You can also use auto-generated anchors and spatial references in transforms:

```yaml
parts:
  mounted_bracket:
    primitive: box
    parameters: {width: 20, height: 5, depth: 30}
    translate:
      to: base.face_top  # auto-generated anchor

  aligned_gear:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters: {radius: 15, height: 10}
    transforms:
      - translate:
          to:
            from: shaft.face_top
            offset: [0, 0, 2]  # Local frame offset
      - rotate:
          angle: 45
          around: shaft.axis_z  # Rotate around axis reference
```

## Operations: Understanding the Four Types

Operations in TiaCAD fall into four categories, each with different purposes:

### Operation Categories

| Category | What It Does | Operations | Think Of It As |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| **1. Positioning** | Change position/orientation (not geometry) | `translate`, `rotate`, `align_to_face` | Moving pieces on a workbench |
| **2. Modifications** | Change geometry itself | `fillet`, `chamfer`, `extrude`, `revolve`, `sweep`, `loft` | Shaping material |
| **3. Combining** | Create relationships between parts | `union`, `difference`, `intersection` | Joining or cutting |
| **4. Replication** | Create multiple copies | `linear_pattern`, `circular_pattern`, `grid_pattern` | Stamping copies |

**Key Insight**: Positioning operations affect WHERE parts are, modification operations affect WHAT they look like, combining operations create NEW geometry, and replication creates COPIES.

**Visual Guide:** See [Operation Categories](docs/diagrams/operation-categories.md) for detailed examples and decision tree.

---

## 1. Positioning Operations (Transforms)

**Purpose**: Move, rotate, or scale parts WITHOUT modifying their geometry.

Move, rotate, or scale parts.

```yaml
operations:
  moved_part:
    type: transform
    input: original_part
    transforms:
      - translate: [x, y, z]      # Move part
      - rotate:                    # Rotate part
          axis: Z                  # X, Y, Z, or [x,y,z]
          angle: 45                # Degrees
          origin: [0, 0, 0]        # Rotation center (REQUIRED)
      - scale: 2.0                 # Uniform scale
      - scale: [2, 1, 1]          # Non-uniform scale
```

**Important:** Transforms apply in order (top to bottom)!

**Rotation origins:**
- `current`: Current part position
- `initial`: Original part position
- `[x, y, z]`: Specific point
- `"part.face('>Z').center"`: Geometric reference (dot notation)

---

### Orientation-Aware Transforms (v3.0+)

New in v3.0: Transform operations that understand both position AND orientation.

#### align_to_face

Align a part to a face reference, matching both position and orientation:

```yaml
operations:
  mounted_bracket:
    type: transform
    input: bracket
    transforms:
      - align_to_face:
          face: base.face_top        # Face reference (auto-generated or named)
          orientation: normal        # Align part's -Z to face normal
          offset: 5                  # Distance from face (optional, default: 0)
```

**How it works:**
1. Rotates part so its -Z axis aligns with the face normal
2. Translates part to face center + offset along normal

**Face references:**
- Named: `mount_surface` (defined in `references:` section)
- Auto-generated: `part.face_top`, `part.face_bottom`, etc.
- Inline: `{type: face, part: base, selector: '>Z'}`

**Common use cases:**
- Mounting brackets to surfaces
- Aligning components to mounting faces
- Positioning parts at specific orientations

#### Frame-Based Rotation

Rotate around spatial references (faces, edges, axes) using the `around:` parameter:

```yaml
operations:
  rotated_gear:
    type: transform
    input: gear
    transforms:
      - rotate:
          angle: 90
          around: shaft_axis        # Spatial reference (not just a point!)
```

**How it works:**
- Uses the reference's orientation as the rotation axis
- Uses the reference's position as the rotation origin

**Supported references:**
- **Face**: Rotates around face normal through face center
- **Edge**: Rotates around edge tangent
- **Axis**: Rotates around axis direction
- **Auto-generated**: `part.face_top`, `part.axis_z`, etc.

**Examples:**

Rotate around a face normal:
```yaml
- rotate:
    angle: 45
    around: base.face_top  # Rotates around normal (Z-axis) through face center
```

Rotate around a custom axis:
```yaml
- rotate:
    angle: 90
    around:
      type: axis
      from: [0, 0, 0]
      to: [0, 1, 0]  # Y-axis
```

Rotate around an edge:
```yaml
- rotate:
    angle: 30
    around:
      type: edge
      part: hinge
      selector: ">X and >Z"
```

**Backward compatibility:**
Traditional rotation (axis + origin) still works:
```yaml
- rotate:
    angle: 90
    axis: Z                 # or [x,y,z]
    origin: [0, 0, 0]       # or 'current' or 'initial'
```

---

---

## 3. Combining Operations (Booleans)

**Purpose**: Create relationships between parts - merge them, subtract one from another, or find their overlap.

Combine parts using set operations.

#### Union (Combine)

```yaml
operations:
  combined:
    type: boolean
    operation: union
    inputs:
      - part1
      - part2
      - part3
```

#### Difference (Subtract)

```yaml
operations:
  plate_with_hole:
    type: boolean
    operation: difference
    base: plate              # Part to subtract from
    subtract:
      - hole1
      - hole2
```

#### Intersection (Overlap)

```yaml
operations:
  overlap:
    type: boolean
    operation: intersection
    inputs:
      - part1
      - part2
```

---

## 4. Replication Operations (Patterns)

**Purpose**: Create multiple copies of a part arranged in a pattern.

Create arrays of parts.

#### Linear Pattern

Repeat along one or more axes:

```yaml
operations:
  linear_array:
    type: pattern
    pattern: linear
    input: bolt_hole
    count: 5                 # Number of copies
    spacing: [20, 0, 0]      # [dx, dy, dz] - X direction spacing
```

**2D Linear Pattern:**

```yaml
operations:
  grid_2d:
    type: pattern
    pattern: linear
    input: hole
    count: [3, 4]           # 3 in X, 4 in Y
    spacing: [20, 25]       # Spacing in each direction
    direction: [X, Y]       # Directions
```

**3D Linear Pattern:**

```yaml
operations:
  grid_3d:
    type: pattern
    pattern: linear
    input: hole
    count: [3, 4, 2]        # X, Y, Z counts
    spacing: [20, 25, 30]   # X, Y, Z spacing
    direction: [X, Y, Z]
```

#### Circular Pattern

Arrange in a circle:

```yaml
operations:
  bolt_circle:
    type: pattern
    pattern: circular
    input: bolt_hole
    count: 6                # Number of copies
    radius: 50              # Circle radius
    axis: Z                 # Rotation axis (X, Y, Z)
    center: [0, 0, 0]       # Circle center point
    start_angle: 0          # Optional: starting angle (degrees)
```

#### Grid Pattern

2D rectangular grid:

```yaml
operations:
  hole_grid:
    type: pattern
    pattern: grid
    input: hole
    count_x: 4              # Columns
    count_y: 3              # Rows
    spacing_x: 20           # Column spacing
    spacing_y: 25           # Row spacing
```

**Pattern Naming:**
Generated parts are named: `{pattern_name}_{index}`

Example: `bolt_circle` creates `bolt_circle_0`, `bolt_circle_1`, etc.

---

## 2. Shape Modification Operations (Features)

**Purpose**: Change the geometry itself - add or remove material, round edges, create 3D shapes from 2D sketches.

Add professional finishing to parts.

#### Fillet (Round Edges)

```yaml
operations:
  rounded_part:
    type: finishing
    finish: fillet
    input: my_part
    radius: 2.0             # Fillet radius
    edges: all              # Which edges to fillet
```

#### Chamfer (Bevel Edges)

**Uniform chamfer:**

```yaml
operations:
  chamfered_part:
    type: finishing
    finish: chamfer
    input: my_part
    length: 1.5             # Chamfer size
    edges: all
```

**Asymmetric chamfer:**

```yaml
operations:
  asymmetric_chamfer:
    type: finishing
    finish: chamfer
    input: my_part
    length: 1.5             # First length
    length2: 1.0            # Second length (different)
    edges: all
```

#### Edge Selection

Control which edges are affected:

**All edges:**

```yaml
edges: all
```

**Direction-based:**

```yaml
edges:
  direction: Z             # Edges aligned with Z axis
  # Also: X, Y, or [x,y,z] vector
```

**Parallel to axis:**

```yaml
edges:
  parallel_to: X           # Edges parallel to X axis
```

**Perpendicular to axis:**

```yaml
edges:
  perpendicular_to: Z      # Edges perpendicular to Z
```

**Advanced (CadQuery selector string):**

```yaml
edges:
  selector: ">Z"           # CadQuery string selector
```

**Important:** Finishing operations modify parts in-place!

---

## Export

Specify which part to export. The output format is determined by the CLI command.

### Simple Export

```yaml
export:
  default_part: final_part   # Name of part to export
```

### Supported Output Formats

TiaCAD supports three output formats via the CLI:

| Format | Extension | Use Case | Quality |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **3MF** | `.3mf` | 3D printing (multi-material, modern slicers) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Recommended |
| **STEP** | `.step` | CAD exchange, engineering, precise geometry | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **STL** | `.stl` | Legacy 3D printing only | ⭐ (binary mesh) |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Default: outputs modern 3MF format

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Parameters for Flexibility

Make designs parametric from the start:

```yaml
parameters:
  # Master dimensions
  base_size: 100

  # Derived dimensions
  half_size: '${base_size / 2}'
  quarter_size: '${base_size / 4}'
```

### 2. Order Matters for Transforms

Transforms apply sequentially. These are different:

```yaml
# Move THEN rotate
transforms:
  - translate: [10, 0, 0]
  - rotate: {axis: Z, angle: 90, origin: [0,0,0]}

# Rotate THEN move (different result!)
transforms:
  - rotate: {axis: Z, angle: 90, origin: [0,0,0]}
  - translate: [10, 0, 0]
```

### 3. Always Specify Rotation Origins

Rotations REQUIRE explicit origins:

```yaml
# ✅ Good
rotate:
  axis: Z
  angle: 45
  origin: [0, 0, 0]

# ❌ Will fail
rotate:
  axis: Z
  angle: 45
```

### 4. Pattern Naming Convention

Patterns generate numbered parts. Plan your boolean operations accordingly:

```yaml
operations:
  my_pattern:
    type: pattern
    pattern: circular
    input: hole
    count: 4

  # Creates: my_pattern_0, my_pattern_1, my_pattern_2, my_pattern_3

  result:
    type: boolean
    operation: difference
    base: plate
    subtract:
      - my_pattern_0
      - my_pattern_1
      - my_pattern_2
      - my_pattern_3
```

### 5. Use Finishing Last

Apply finishing operations after all boolean/pattern operations:

```yaml
operations:
  # 1. Create parts
  # 2. Pattern them
  # 3. Boolean operations
  # 4. Finishing (last!)
  finished:
    type: finishing
    finish: fillet
    input: assembled_part
```

### 6. Test Incrementally

Build complex designs step by step:

1. Start with basic parts
2. Add one operation at a time
3. Export and verify each step
4. Add complexity gradually

## Common Patterns

### Mounting Plate with Bolt Circle

```yaml
parameters:
  bolt_count: 6
  bolt_circle_radius: 50

operations:
  bolt_circle:
    type: pattern
    pattern: circular
    input: bolt_hole
    count: '${bolt_count}'
    radius: '${bolt_circle_radius}'
    axis: Z
    center: [0, 0, 0]
```

### Grid of Holes

```yaml
operations:
  hole_grid:
    type: pattern
    pattern: grid
    input: hole
    count_x: 4
    count_y: 3
    spacing_x: 20
    spacing_y: 25
```

### Rounded Edges (Safety)

```yaml
operations:
  rounded:
    type: finishing
    finish: fillet
    input: sharp_part
    radius: 2.0
    edges: all
```

### Chamfered Edges (Strength)

```yaml
operations:
  chamfered:
    type: finishing
    finish: chamfer
    input: part
    length: 1.5
    edges:
      direction: Z
```

## Migration from v0.3.0

If you have existing v0.3.0 YAML files, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE_V3.md](docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE_V3.md) for detailed migration instructions.

**Key Changes:**
- `named_points:` → `references:` with explicit `type` field
- Auto-generated references (e.g., `part.face_top`)
- `size:` → `parameters:` for primitive dimensions
- Local frame offsets for intuitive positioning
- Face/edge/axis references (not just points)
