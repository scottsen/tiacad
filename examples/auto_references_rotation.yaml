# auto-generated anchors Example: Rotation with Auto-Axes
#
# Demonstrates using auto-generated axis references for rotation.
#
# auto-generated anchors used:
# - base.axis_x - X-axis through base center
# - base.axis_y - Y-axis through base center
# - base.axis_z - Z-axis through base center
# - base.center - Center point of base

parts:
  # Central base cube
  base:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 30
      height: 30
      depth: 30

  # Arm extending along X-axis
  arm_x:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 60
      height: 8
      depth: 8
    translate:
      to: base.center

  # Arm rotated 90° around Z-axis (along Y-axis)
  arm_y:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 60
      height: 8
      depth: 8
    translate:
      to: base.center
    rotate:
      axis: base.axis_z  # auto-generated anchor to base's Z-axis
      angle: 90
      origin: base.center

  # Arm rotated 90° around Y-axis (along Z-axis)
  arm_z:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 60
      height: 8
      depth: 8
    translate:
      to: base.center
    rotate:
      axis: base.axis_y  # auto-generated anchor to base's Y-axis
      angle: 90
      origin: base.center

  # Diagonal arm (rotated around two axes)
  arm_diagonal:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 50
      height: 6
      depth: 6
    translate:
      to: base.center
    rotate:
      axis: base.axis_z
      angle: 45
      origin: base.center

# Export the assembly
export:
  default_part: arm_diagonal
  formats:
    - step
    - stl

# Result: A 3D cross with arms extending in different directions
# - Auto-axes make rotation intuitive without manual axis calculation
# - All rotations are relative to the base's coordinate system
