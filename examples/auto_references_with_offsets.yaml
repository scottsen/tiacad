# auto-generated anchors Example: Using Offsets
#
# Demonstrates combining auto-generated anchors with offsets to create
# spacing between parts.
#
# Shows how to use the `from` and `offset` syntax with auto-generated anchors.

parts:
  # Platform base
  platform:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 100
      height: 5
      depth: 100

  # Four corner posts - positioned with offsets from center
  post_1:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 3
      height: 40
    translate:
      to:
        from: platform.face_top
        offset: [-35, -35, 0]  # Front-left corner

  post_2:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 3
      height: 40
    translate:
      to:
        from: platform.face_top
        offset: [35, -35, 0]  # Front-right corner

  post_3:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 3
      height: 40
    translate:
      to:
        from: platform.face_top
        offset: [-35, 35, 0]  # Back-left corner

  post_4:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 3
      height: 40
    translate:
      to:
        from: platform.face_top
        offset: [35, 35, 0]  # Back-right corner

  # Top platform - positioned above posts with gap
  top_platform:
    primitive: box
    parameters:
      width: 80
      height: 5
      depth: 80
    translate:
      to:
        from: post_1.face_top
        offset: [0, 0, 5]  # 5 units above the post tops

# Export the assembly
export:
  default_part: top_platform
  formats:
    - step
    - stl

# Result: A platform with four corner posts and a top platform
# - Offsets allow precise positioning relative to auto-generated anchors
# - Easy to adjust spacing by changing offset values
