# auto-generated anchors Example: Cylinder Assembly
#
# Demonstrates using auto-generated anchors with cylinders to create
# a shaft with caps on both ends.
#
# auto-generated anchors used:
# - shaft.face_top - Top circular face of cylinder
# - shaft.face_bottom - Bottom circular face of cylinder
# - shaft.axis_z - Vertical axis through shaft center

parts:
  # Main shaft
  shaft:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 5
      height: 50

  # Top cap - larger diameter, sits on top of shaft
  top_cap:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 8
      height: 3
    translate:
      to: shaft.face_top  # auto-generated anchor to shaft's top face

  # Bottom cap - larger diameter, sits on bottom of shaft
  bottom_cap:
    primitive: cylinder
    parameters:
      radius: 8
      height: 3
    translate:
      to: shaft.face_bottom  # auto-generated anchor to shaft's bottom face

  # Decorative sphere on top
  sphere_top:
    primitive: sphere
    parameters:
      radius: 6
    translate:
      to:
        from: top_cap.face_top
        offset: [0, 0, 0]  # Sits right on the cap

# Export the assembly
export:
  default_part: sphere_top
  formats:
    - step
    - stl

# Result: A cylinder with caps on both ends and a sphere on top
# - All parts perfectly aligned without manual coordinate calculation
# - If shaft height changes, caps and sphere automatically adjust
